# logger-data-analysis
This repository contains data and (generally python) analysis code associated with
our data logger. This is different from the analysis code for the data from the
network of air quality sensors distributed throughout East Boston (available [here](https://github.com/airpartners/data-analysis)).
There is some additional logger data anlysis code in R [here](https://github.com/airpartners/data-analysis-r),
and the repository with details about the logger itself is avaliable [here](https://github.com/airpartners/logger).
